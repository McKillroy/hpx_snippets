<h1>(Draft) Requirements for a system of persistent id_types for HPX components<a class="headerlink" href="#draft-requirements-for-a-system-of-persistent-id-types-for-hpx-components" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>id_types need to be (optionally) persistent over store/load cycles. Otherwise, References to stored objects may become invalid. This is also required for complete application shutdowns and restarts with different locality configurations (see point 6).</p></li>
<li><p>The current system stores locality IDs embedded into the id_type such, that the id quickly tells a client which locality is responsible for resolution of the final component location. This essentially is an implicit segmentation of the entire space for possible id_types into a segment of the size of a locality id space, which currently is 87 bit (see <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx/blob/master/hpx/runtime/agas/server/primary_namespace.hpp#L52-L112">https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx/blob/master/hpx/runtime/agas/server/primary_namespace.hpp#L52-L112</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>The current id system could no longer serve its purpose if the locality whose id is embedded into the components id_type is down, but the component is loaded ( Is this actually possible at all ?). We need independence of the system from a specific locality being up or down. See also point 7</p></li>
<li><p>An Id system supporting persistence would require a central authority handing out id blocks since the natural segmentation of the id space by locality id would no longer be valid. Another form of segmentation is needed.</p></li>
<li><p>To solve the problem a change in the Global ID system is needed, by replacing the current implicit id space segmentation into an explicitly managed one.</p></li>
<li><p>Checkpointing of a set of objects to a persistent storage medium with the goal of being able to restore those while maintaining cross references must support differing locality configurations (number of localities), i.e. the checkpointed application may run on a different number of localities compared to the restored application.</p></li>
<li><p>AGAS is currently a distributed database without replication. Each locality has its AGAS instance, all taken together expose the full AGAS functionality. Every locality is responsible for the objects created on it. The locality even stays responsible for the address resolution of its objects if those have been migrated away to another locality.</p></li>
<li><p>It is important, that the redistribution of stored objects to localities at load time can be customized. Spatially constrained simulations need to roughly keep objects which are close to each other in the simulation also together in one locality to minimize the object crosstalk penalty. Crosstalk across locality boundaries is expensive. To minimize the object crosstalk cost the cluster must become a rough mapping of the spatial situation of the simulation. E.g. a game simulation running on 4 localities might distribute objects on the worldmap into 4 quadrants, like NE, NW, SE, SW map quadrant (or any other spatial segmentation scheme), where each quadrant in this example would be run by a locality. This could actually result in long running simulations with lots of spatial repositioning of objects to run more optimized after such a store/load cycle, which can essentially be seen as an object redistribution cycle.</p></li>

<h2>Suggestion B:<a class="headerlink" href="#suggestion-b" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A new implicit segmentation schema: Hashing the id_types</p>
<p>The old segmentation schema for the id_type space uses localities to segment the id_types. It is simple because of this implicit segmentation, but that also causes the problems with persistence.</p>
<p>Idea: Maybe just using the lowest n bits to select a bucket/responsible locality? → superfast hashing and bucket determination</p>
<p>Another way to implicitly determine the location of the dictionary service could be hashing. Hashing the id_type of a component would result in a hash, which would be the key in the segmentation table.</p>
<p>The disadvantage would be, that creation of an object would most of the time require the id to be managed elsewhere.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="suggestion-c">
<h2>Suggestion C:<a class="headerlink" href="#suggestion-c" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Allow a change of the responsible locality and keep a local cache entry to it.</p>
<p>This would allow migration of objects and their managing locality on the fly.</p>
<p>Failure of requests would lead to local cache invalidation and re-caching after resolving by some mechanism (some directory service or something similar).</p>
