Section 1 : About this Document and the associated Git Repository
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a draft  / work document I am using, while I am trying to get my head around HPX and build an HPX based distributed application. 

The purpose of this document is twofold: It helps me learning and it is a collection of acquired knowledge and recipes which might find their way back into the HPX documentation if people find them useful.

So ??? 
  Consider everything here unfinished, full of bugs and work in progress!

Disclaimer
  The views and thoughts I am posting here are not academic views, but my thoughts as I am developing an application based on HPX. I'm not a computer scientist, but a self taught hobbyist.

Special thanks
  to Hartmut Kaiser, Thomas Heller and the Ste||ar group IRC channel for enduring me pestering people with unrelated C++ newbie questions, bloopers, false bug reports and other nonsense while I'm working on my project. Most of the writeups here is directly extracted from what I learned there and in private chats. Errors are solely my responsibility.
