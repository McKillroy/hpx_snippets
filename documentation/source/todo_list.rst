Work Doc : Current ToDo List
===============================

Open Questions
-----------------

Threads
    * How can I get the Ids of all HPX worker threads?
    * How can I run code on a specific worker thread?

* Can I run local non-action functions directly with hpx?

What exactly do the Macros do? what is the underlying mechanic?
    See also :doc:`macros_for_components_and_actions`

 
* Which of HPX includes do I need when?
    On include to rule them all: ``<hpx/hpx.hpp>`` - how to narrow scope?


* Recommended build methods and examples.
    VS, VSCODE, CMake, vcpkg, ...

Caveats, gotchas and quirks
-------------------------------------
    * Confusing function and action names in macro parameters
