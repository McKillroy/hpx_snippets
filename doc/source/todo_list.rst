CHapter 4: Current ToDo List
=============================

Open Questions
-----------------
* How can I get the Ids of all HPX worker threads?
* How can I run code on a specific worker thread?
* Can I run local non-action functions directly with hpx?

* What exactly do the Macros do? what is the underlying mechanic of:

    * HPX_DECLARE_PLAIN_ACTION
    * HPX_DEFINE_PLAIN_ACTION
    * HPX_PLAIN_ACTION
    * HPX_PLAIN_ACTION_ID
    * HPX_REGISTER_COMPONENT_MODULE
    * HPX_REGISTER_COMPONENT
    * HPX_REGISTER_ACTION

 
* Which HPX include do I need when?
    * Linker error between luaengine and controller because of luaengine.hpp include?

* Recommended build methods and examples
